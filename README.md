# ESP32-BLE-MIDI-Footswitch
A simple ESP32 BLE MIDI Footswitch to send control changes using Bluetooth 

This is a simple Bluetooth Midi controller that will send control change to a midi app that can receive it 

I use this on my iPAD using the free app midimittr and JamUP pro

it works also with any other app that can receive and understand MIDI from Bluetooth 

thank you to Pieter P for providing this superb library https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface 
it can do allot more than sending control changes :D but that's all I needed ;)
